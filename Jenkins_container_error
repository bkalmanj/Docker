Whenever you are trying to create a jenkins container and facing with the below error. 
1) Check firewall, if it is enabled then check if the port is added to it and try to restart firewalld.
2) If firewall is disabled. Then restart docker and try to execute the command again. 


[root@docker ~]# docker run -p 8080:8080 --name=jenkins-practice jenkins/jenkins
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint jenkins-practice 
(4f35408535d9f6ba7422e0286cb0f49bfa7da59d9873242e1aa5f900185a1351):  (iptables failed: iptables --wait -t nat -A 
DOCKER -p tcp -d 0/0 --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.17.0.2:8080 ! -i docker0: iptables: No chain/target/match by that name.
 (exit status 1)).
